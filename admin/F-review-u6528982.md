Review Comments:

1. Viewer.java:53-63, arraies of "Image" items are created by assoicating the real png images 
and the "Image" items in the scene.
 

2. Viewer.java:67-105 is is the most important algorithm of task04.
Each card in the placement will be identified by this for-loop, 
so we know the position (row and column number) of each card in our arries of "Images",
therefore we can put the real images in our grids.

3. The methods and variables are properly named, easy to understand, but some comments may need to be added.

4. Viewer.java is not showing the frame line, it should be added.
